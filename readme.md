## Tasks

- [x] Create web page
- [x] Add details about myself in table format
- [x] Add images for both background and profile

## Leaning curve and challenges

- First of all, it was bit difficult to adjust content in the page because there is not such huge data here but somehow I managed to arrange data and also I have set background image for better view rather than plain white background and also I organized every data in proper manner using tables.
- Secondly, it was difficult to setup github and push everything on it. Somehow, I managed it after searching on github.
